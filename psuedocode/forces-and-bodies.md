# Heres what we know

- there will be a position
- there will be velocities (and inertia)
- there will be accelleration, attraction and repulsion
- there will be attraction and repulsion that is raises/lowers depending on distance between two bodies
  - Boolean retricted from the context of a "body"
- rises/lowers/distances change depending on the number of bodies within the distance
  - When a 2 bodies collide
    - We find out how to get a equilibrium
      - They may have even forces and create a straight line
      - it may be uneven and we have to find out who is concave and who is convex
      - Both bodies get additional Pressure depending on the difference between the current volume and desired volume and attempt to force outward to compensate for that.
  - As pressure increases for a body
    - repulsion to all intersecting bodies increases
    - radius increases in areas not under pressure

  - PV = T
    - First we see that the

Collision Stories
- "Bounces" and Velocity results are dependent on
  - Pressure Resistance of both objects
    - as resistance rises, pressure is less likely to be effected
  - Recovery rate of both objects
    - As recovery Rate rises, as pressure rises, outward force increases
- Hugh Pressure resistance
  - Should work similar to marbels
  - Should make the effects of recovery rate possibly unviewable
- Body a and body b both have a high recovery rate
  - Doesn't matter the size or velocities
  - Will return back to expected shape quickly
  - Will cause bounce
- Body a and Body b are both the same size and same velocity and hit head on
  - As initial velocity increases
    - Smushing will increase until all initial velocity as been dispersed horizontally
  - If they have low recovery rate
    - Smush togethor and slowly come undone
  - The Higher the velocity
    - The more horizontal the shape will become
      - when inertia hasn't been fully satisfied yet can't push towards the direction desired
- One body has a much higher radius than the other
  - if the bigger body has a low recover rate or the other body has a high enough velocity
    - The smaller one will rip through the bigger one
  - else
    - Will see the bigger have its unimpacted parts attempt to continue forward
- If two bodies are pushing a third from a less a 180 degree angle from both sides
  - The pushed body will gradually shift its radius away from the two bodies and reach peak volume again
